        <li>1 onion (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove (sliced)</li>
        <li>thyme (sprigs)</li>
        <li>400g mixed wild mushrooms</li>
        <li>850ml vegetable stock</li>
        <li>200ml sour cream</li>
        <li>4 slices white bread (about 100g, cubed)</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a kettle to the boil, then pour the water over the dried porcini just to cover. Heat half the butter in a saucepan, then gently sizzle the onion, garlic and thyme for 5 mins until softened and starting to brown. Drain the porcini, reserving the juice, then add to the onion with the mixed wild mushrooms. Leave to cook for 5 mins until they go limp.</li>
        <li>Pour over the stock and the reserved juices, bring to the boil, then simmer for 20 mins. Stir in sour cream, then simmer for a few mins more. Blitz the soup with a hand blender or liquidiser, pass through a fine sieve, then set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining butter in a frying pan, fry the bread cubes until golden, then drain on kitchen paper. To serve, heat the soup and froth up with a hand blender, if you like. Ladle the soup into bowls, scatter over the cro√ªtons and chives and drizzle with truffle oil.</li>
    </ol>
