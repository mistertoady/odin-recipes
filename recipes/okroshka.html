    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Okroshka is a healthy cold Russian soup that’s full of crunchy radishes and cucumbers, flavorful with dill, and refreshing with a creamy, tangy yogurt-like base.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Persian cucumbers – these are small, narrow cucumbers with a thin skin and very few seeds; if you can’t find them, you can substitute with an English (hothouse) cucumber</li>
        <li>Radishes – use any type of radish you have</li>
        <li>Waxy potatoes – such as Yukon Gold potatoes; starchy potatoes (such as Russet) will also work here, but I prefer the flavor and texture of yellow potatoes for this chilled soup</li>
        <li>Hard-boiled eggs – this adds flavor and protein</li>
        <li>Scallion – this adds a mild onion flavor; chives would also work well here</li>
        <li>Dill – fresh dill wakes up the flavor of this refreshing summer soup</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt – use less salt if you’re using regular fine-grain table salt</li>
        <li>Kefir – this is a drink made from fermented milk with a tangy flavor similar to yogurt; its texture is like a thin, pourable yogurt</li>
        <li>Mineral water – this adds refreshing bubbles to this cold soup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil, cool, peel, and dice the potatoes and eggs. Chop the cucumbers, radishes, scallion, and dill.</li>
        <li>Divide the cucumber, radish, potato, egg, scallion, and dill between each of 4 shallow soup bowls. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of flaky sea salt on the vegetables in each bowl.</li>
        <li>Gently stir together the kefir and mineral water in a pitcher. (Don’t over-mix or you’ll lose all the bubbles.) Pour 1 cup of the kefir mixture into each bowl.</li>
    </ol>
